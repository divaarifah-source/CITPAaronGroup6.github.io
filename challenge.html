        <p class="section-lead">Saibai Island sits within the Torres Strait, a low-lying mud island only kilometres from Papua New Guinea. Climate shifts are reshaping its coastline and livelihood.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="challenge-context">
        <p>Saibai’s foundations are layers of mangrove sediment, resting barely above sea level. Intensifying king tides, storm surges, and sea-level rise now inundate homes several times a year. Saltwater intrusion contaminates precious freshwater lenses, while chronic flooding accelerates shoreline loss and threatens food production and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>These pressures compound on a community whose cultural identity is inseparable from Country. Elders describe how burial grounds and culturally significant trees are being swept away, eroding stories that have anchored Saibai life for generations.</p>

            <p>The protective coastal forests are dying. Saltwater floods kill the roots. Without these natural barriers, waves hammer the shoreline and tear away the land. Every storm makes it worse.</p>

            <h3>Culture is Being Erased</h3>

        <p>How do you save an island community from rising seas without concrete walls that fail, without forcing people to leave their home, and without spending millions on endless repairs? How do you protect both the land AND the culture that makes it meaningful?</p>

          <p>The Saibai community needs a solution they can maintain themselves—one that protects their homes, saves their sacred sites, preserves their fresh water, and keeps them on the land their ancestors walked. They need something that works with nature instead of fighting it. And they need it before it's too late.</p>

          <article>
            <h3>Concrete Seawalls (2015–2021)</h3>
            <p>Big concrete barriers seemed strong. But the ocean is stronger. Waves undermine the walls. Cyclones crack them. Worse, the walls bounce wave energy back, making erosion worse nearby. Constant repairs eat up budgets.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Planting New Coastal Forests</h3>
            <p>The community tried replanting forests by hand. Some trees grew. But most died because the soil keeps washing away faster than roots can grab hold. Without fixing the erosion first, replanting alone can't work.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Drainage and Water Channels</h3>
            <p>Engineers dug channels to manage flooding in some areas. It helped with water flow. But it didn't stop the soil from washing away or address the bigger picture. The island kept shrinking.</p>

        <h2 id="opportunity-heading">There's a Better Way</h2>
        <p>What if instead of fighting the ocean, we worked with it? What if we could help the island rebuild itself naturally—the way it was formed in the first place?</p>
        <p>Our solution uses simple wooden structures to slow the waves and trap soil. As the land builds up, coastal forests regrow on their own. These living barriers protect better than concrete ever could. The community does the work. They maintain it. They control it. No expensive contractors. No imported materials. Just nature doing what it does best—when given a little help.</p>
